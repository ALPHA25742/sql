alter table Course add column changed_at timestamp default now() -- when I added it filled all the rows that existed with the time when I added this column
insert into Course(CourseName,CourseDuration_Months,CourseFee) values ("AIML camp",2.5,3999)

-- update sql bootcmap fee to 3999
update Course set CourseFee=2999 where CourseID=3 -- but this doesnt change the change_at timestamp, for which we've to define the column as following
alter table Course modify column changed_at timestamp default now() on update now()
desc Course
